            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Shehab Ahmed, a 4th-year Automation Engineering student at McMaster University with a strong background in industrial automation, IoT, and smart technologies.  
                I enjoy working with control systems, robotics, and cloud-integrated devices, finding ways to make technology more efficient and practical.  
            
                My background includes experience in PLC programming, embedded systems, and automation software, where I've built and optimized various projects, from IoT-driven smart devices to intelligent manufacturing solutions.              
                Outside of engineering, I'm a big fan of sports, having played soccer and volleyball competitively. I also enjoy cooking and trying out different cuisines.
